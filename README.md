# DungeonJunkie
The GitHub page for the publicly driven Dungeon Junkie project. Direct Download links are above. Patches releases in numerical order. Releases beginning with 4 are HTML, not Python. The HTML files are standalone releases of the Bitsy Graphical Mod. A tutorial for editing these files will be released soon.
A big thanks to Ian Eisenhower for supporting the game and recreating it for Python 3!
